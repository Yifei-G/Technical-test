# Technical Test

## About this project

This is a technical test, you can find the requirement in ExecerciseJS.txt. The main goal is creating a path (a string variable) by iterating the categories array provided in the txt file.

You can find the solution in solution_recursive.js where getCategoryPath is a recursive function in order to repeat the same logic (if necessary) until we find the full path.

## How to run the solution

If you have node installed, you can go to the project folder and run the following command:

### Node version
tested node version: v10.23.0

```
node solution_recursive.js
```

You can also see the result by opening the dummy.html and check the console of your browser. 

## How to run the test

The solution function has been tested using Qunit (imported this testing library via CDN in the test_output.html. You need internet connection to see the test result)

You can see the test result by opening the test_output.html located in test folder
